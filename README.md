# UBC JupyterDay 2018

[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) is web application for producing computational narratives: a notebook in the browser which runs code and renders text, mathematical notation, images and videos. Jupyter notebooks are a powerful open source tool for scientific computing and reproducible research.

[The Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS)](http://www.pims.math.ca/) hosts Jupyter notebooks on [syzygy.ca](http://syzygy.ca/) and JupyterDay is an opportunity for instructors, researchers and students at UBC to share their Jupyter experiences and to learn about new Jupyter tools.

[UBC JupyterDay 2018](http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/180816-uj
) is hosted by the [UBC Department of Mathematics](http://www.math.ubc.ca/) and [PIMS](http://www.pims.math.ca/). The event takes place in the newly renovated Undergraduate Mathematics Computer Lab (LSK 121) designed for the collaborative teaching and learning of computation and data science.

* Thursday August 16, 2018
* 12-4pm
* Undergraduate Mathematics Computer Lab, LSK 121
* See [PIMS event page](http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/180816-uj)
